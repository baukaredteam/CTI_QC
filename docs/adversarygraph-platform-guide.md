## Visual Evidence

Platform screenshots are stored in
[`docs/assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform`](assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform/manifest.md).
That folder is historical: the screenshots illustrate stable workflow concepts
but are not current-`main` release evidence. The Asset Surface and Discover
addendum is stored in
[`docs/assets/adversarygraph-v4.1-platform`](assets/adversarygraph-v4.1-platform/manifest.md).
The malware-analysis screenshot set is stored in
[`docs/assets/malware-analysis-v4`](assets/malware-analysis-v4/manifest.md).
Those v4 malware screenshots remain representative for the tagged v6.0.0
Malware Analysis workflow.
The v5 Attack Simulation screenshot set is stored in
[`docs/assets/attack-simulation-v5`](assets/attack-simulation-v5/manifest.md).
The tagged v6.0.0 release evidence pack is stored in
[`docs/assets/adversarygraph-v6`](assets/adversarygraph-v6/manifest.md).

The screenshot packs include validation metadata. The platform set records
route load, expected page text, `1920x1200` dimensions, byte size, mean RGB, and
nonblank image checks in
[`validation.json`](assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform/validation.json).

The v4.1 addendum validates the representative Discover launcher layout, Asset
Surface analysis output, saved analysis history, and the white Navigator layer
created from asset-inventory TTP candidates.

The v5 Attack Simulation set validates the TTP-first simulation matrix, per-TTP
configuration page, SIEM forwarding controls, AI scenario library, generated
attack-chain graph, explain-attack panel, real-time log view, and saved SIEM
destination history.

## Core Workflow

AdversaryGraph is built around this defensive CTI workflow:

```text
report / IOC / malware sample / feed source
  -> extraction and enrichment
  -> unified exact, full-text, relationship, and optional vector retrieval
  -> citation-bound answer or temporary Navigator proposal
  -> ATT&CK / ATLAS mapping candidates
  -> analyst validation
  -> actor, campaign, sector, and IOC pivots
  -> comparison and detection-gap review
  -> hypothesis-driven threat hunt and reviewed outcome
  -> evidence-to-detection reasoning graph
  -> investigation report, exports, and operational handoff
```

The platform keeps the source of each conclusion visible. A technique selected
from an uploaded report, an actor profile, an IOC feed, a malware sample, or an
AI assistant should remain traceable back to evidence.

## Detailed Module Casebook

The [Module Reference and Casebook](module-reference.md) is the canonical
module-by-module operating reference for the current source tree. It covers all
31 governed workspaces with route and access context, prerequisites, repeatable
steps, outputs, worked examples, realistic case studies, acceptance evidence,
and explicit limits. Its module coverage is checked against the backend
`MODULE_CATALOG` in CI so a newly governed module cannot be added without
documentation.

## Evidence-to-Detection Graph

The Evidence Graph page connects AdversaryGraph modules into one operational
reasoning model:

```text
Evidence -> Claim -> Behavior -> ATT&CK Technique -> Required Telemetry
  -> Detection Candidate -> Detection Rule -> Validation Scenario
  -> SIEM Result -> Analyst Decision
```

Use it when a report, IOC, malware finding, asset exposure, attack simulation,
or SIEM result needs to become a reviewed detection-engineering outcome. The
graph separates confirmed evidence, analyst claims, inferred behavior, ATT&CK
mapping, detection hypothesis, validation result, and final analyst decision.

AI-generated nodes and edges are saved as drafts. Analysts can approve, reject,
request more evidence, create next-step nodes, review gaps, and export JSON,
Markdown, CSV, or an Evidence Pack. See
[`docs/evidence-to-detection-graph.md`](evidence-to-detection-graph.md).

## Module Walkthrough

### Discover

![Discover dashboard](assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform/01-discover-dashboard.png)

The Discover page is the command surface for starting analyst work. It links to
Navigator, AI Analysis, actor comparison, sector intelligence, IOC workflows,
malware analysis, operations, and troubleshooting.

### Navigator

![ATT&CK Navigator matrix](assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform/02-navigator-matrix.png)

Navigator is the matrix review surface. Analysts select techniques, inspect
evidence, expand sub-techniques, overlay actors or comparison layers, track
coverage, and export matrix-compatible layers.

### Intelligence RAG Assistant

Open **ATT&CK Navigator → AI RAG assistant** to search the platform's
normalized intelligence corpus without leaving the matrix workflow. Search uses
exact identifiers and PostgreSQL full text by default. When an approved private
embedding model is enabled, vector candidates are added and all retrieval modes
are fused into one ranked result set. The result labels the active retrieval
mode and keeps every source route, TLP marking, legal-sensitive flag, excerpt,
and citation visible.

For organization-specific questions, create or select a business profile with
sector, region, technologies, and crown-jewel terms. For example:

```text
Find IOCs relevant to an Israel-based technology company. Explain the actor,
campaign, CVE, or TTP relationship that makes each IOC worth reviewing.
```

The profile changes ranking context; it does not prove that an actor targets the
organization or that an IOC is currently active. Follow each citation to the
authoritative platform record and validate freshness, confidence, and source
provenance before operational use.

The assistant can also answer:

```text
Propose the ATT&CK techniques relevant to this business and preview them on
Navigator. Use only cited evidence.
```

A proposal is a temporary overlay until the analyst reviews the citations and
explicitly confirms **Add** or **Replace**. Confirmation changes the current
browser selection only; it does not save a named layer, create a hunt, execute a
query, run a simulation, or initiate a response action. See
[Unified Intelligence RAG and MCP](unified-rag-and-mcp.md) for source coverage,
permissions, indexing, retrieval semantics, provider governance, and API
contracts.

### ATT&CK Group Library

![ATT&CK Group Library](assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform/03-apt-library.png)

The group library connects actor profiles to aliases, techniques, campaigns,
reports, source-backed IOCs, and Navigator actions. Actor links are investigation
leads, not attribution proof.

### AI Analysis

![AI Analysis](assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform/04-ai-analysis.png)

AI Analysis ingests report text or uploaded documents and extracts ATT&CK/ATLAS
mapping candidates. The page keeps provider choice, source text, extracted
evidence, accepted TTPs, and saved report sessions separate.

### Compare

![Compare reports and layers](assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform/05-compare-behavior.png)

Compare uses the current TTP layer or saved reports to rank overlap with groups
and campaigns. It supports group comparison, campaign comparison, report
comparison, tactic distribution, matrix diff, and detection-gap review.

### Group vs Group

![Group vs Group comparison](assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform/06-group-vs-group.png)

Group vs Group compares multiple actor profiles directly. It highlights shared
techniques, actor-exclusive techniques, tactic coverage, and combined matrix
patterns.

### Sector Intel

![Sector Intelligence](assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform/07-sector-intel.png)

Sector Intel ranks actor relevance for a client context. Inputs include sector,
region, technology/environment keywords, activity window, campaign recency, and
MISP Galaxy evidence.

### RetroHunt

![RetroHunt](assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform/08-retrohunt.png)

RetroHunt searches local historical intelligence for repeated indicators,
techniques, tool names, actor references, and evidence fragments.

### Threat Hunting

Threat Hunting is the operational workspace for hypothesis-driven searches in
organization-owned telemetry. It keeps analyst-created and Threat Radar-created
hunts in one queue, preserves TLP, source context, scope, ATT&CK techniques,
required telemetry and fields, false-positive considerations, findings, and a
reviewed outcome.

Queries are stored as append-only revisions with checksums. Analysts copy them
to an approved telemetry backend and attach evidence references; the module does
not claim that AdversaryGraph executed an external SIEM query. Completed,
cancelled, and archived hunts are read-only, and archive actions preserve the
record instead of deleting it. Navigator can prefill a hunt from a selected
technique, while Threat Radar writes directly into the same canonical queue.

The adjacent **Query Library** provides reviewed Sigma and YARA-L starting
points plus source-backed community rules collected through Pipeline. Search
supports ordinary text, typed autocomplete, facets, and fielded filters such as
<code>tag:persistence</code>, <code>ttp:T1059.001</code>, and
<code>lang:yaral</code>. Each result preserves its source URL, license context,
parser status, tags, platforms, and direct ATT&CK links. Analysts can create a
hunt draft from a result or build a deterministic Sigma, YARA-L, YARA, KQL,
SPL, EQL, Lucene, SQL, osquery, or generic query from supplied IOCs.

See the comprehensive
[`Threat Hunting: From Hypothesis to Defensible Detection`](threat-hunting-guide.md)
guide for program design, telemetry engineering, execution controls, templates,
checklists, and twenty worked playbooks.
Query Library operation, search syntax, feed indexing, IOC drafting, and the
production review checklist are documented in
[Threat Hunting Query Library](query-library.md).

### Knowledge Library

![Knowledge Library](assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform/09-knowledge-library.png)

The Knowledge Library stores and browses reports, references, entities, and
saved intelligence material used by investigations and exports.

### IOC Library

![IOC Library](assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform/10-ioc-library.png)

The IOC Library is the searchable observable store. It shows freshness, source
attribution, enrichment values, mapped TTPs, actor links, and pivot actions.

### IOC Investigation

![IOC Investigation](assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform/11-ioc-investigation.png)

IOC Investigation performs a pivot workflow for a single observable. It can
collect reputation, DNS, relationship graph data, external provider context, and
timeline evidence depending on configured keys.

### VirusTotal Lookup

![VirusTotal Lookup](assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform/12-virustotal-lookup.png)

VirusTotal Lookup provides on-demand enrichment for hashes, IPs, domains, and
URLs. Results can feed mapped TTPs and actor context back into Navigator and IOC
workflows.

### Feeds Management

![Feeds Management](assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform/13-feeds-management.png)

Feeds Management controls platform data synchronization: ATT&CK/ATLAS, IOC
sources, MISP/custom feeds, OpenCTI, STIX/TAXII, detection-content feeds, and
sandbox behavior imports.

### Investigation Report

![Investigation report](assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform/14-investigation-report.png)

The report workspace prepares analyst handoff material from selected techniques,
evidence, IOC pivots, actor context, detection gaps, and investigation notes.

### Operations

![Operations](assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform/15-operations.png)

Operations manages investigation workspaces, tracked actors, detection lifecycle
items, report intake, evidence records, and operational task context.

### Pipeline

![Pipeline imports](assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform/16-pipeline.png)

Pipeline connects external intelligence sources and detection-content sources to
the local platform. It supports source registration, import review, and mapping
imported behavior to matrix techniques.

### Administration

Administration provides persistent native users and SOC access groups. A
Platform Administrator can create a named user, select the smallest suitable
group, keep the compatibility role at `viewer`, and verify the account's
effective module count before testing sign-in. The creation form shows the
server password policy, reports incomplete input in an accessible checklist,
supports browser/password-manager autofill, and prevents duplicate requests
while creation is pending.

Module visibility is not the security boundary: backend routers enforce the
same group-derived module and action grants. Delegated user managers cannot
grant authority beyond their own, and the platform prevents removal of the
final enabled user-management path. See
[Authentication and User Management](authentication-and-users.md#create-a-named-user).

### DFIR Examples

![DFIR Examples](assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform/17-dfir-examples.png)

DFIR Examples provides public sample workflows and report material for demos,
training, validation, and regression checking without private data.

### Troubleshooting

![Troubleshooting](assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform/18-troubleshooting.png)

Troubleshooting shows deployment health, self-test results, Docker/API checks,
provider configuration state, and recovery guidance.

### Sector Packs

![Sector packs](assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform/19-sector-packs.png)

Sector Packs package reusable client or industry context: relevant actors,
techniques, intelligence notes, and recommended review paths.

### IOC Node Detail

![IOC node detail](assets/adversarygraph-v4-platform/20-ioc-node-detail.png)

IOC Node Detail treats an observable as a graph entity and exposes enrichment,
linked TTPs, source evidence, relationship context, and actions.

## Asset Attack Surface Mapping

Asset Surface maps CMDB exports, scanner output, cloud asset lists, and plain
host/IP inventories into a defensive attack surface matrix. The workflow
normalizes owners, environments, IPs, domains, ports, technologies, exposure,
and criticality, then produces risk levels, likely entry points, ATT&CK
technique candidates, priority actions, assumptions, validation gaps, and
optional AI-enriched executive findings.
Each completed run creates a saved case so analysts can reopen the exact matrix,
compare inventory changes, export JSON evidence, and send the same TTP set back
to Navigator later.

The module is useful when the starting point is infrastructure rather than a
report, IOC, actor, or malware sample. It helps answer:

- Which assets appear internet-facing, internal, third-party, or unknown?
- Which assets combine high business criticality with exposed administration,
  web/API, database, identity, container, or remote-access surfaces?
- Which likely ATT&CK techniques should be reviewed in Navigator and detection
  planning?
- Which facts must be validated with scanner, cloud firewall, WAF, CMDB, and
  telemetry data before operational action?

See the dedicated [Asset Attack Surface Mapping](asset-attack-surface.md)
guide for accepted inventory fields and output semantics.

## Attack Simulation

Attack Simulation is the v5 detection-validation workspace. Analysts select an
ATT&CK technique first, open a dedicated simulation page, run approved lab
scenarios, inspect real-time target-side logs, and forward telemetry to a SIEM
collector. Web scenarios use the Docker `attack-lab-web` target, which receives
real HTTP requests and writes target-side NGINX access, security/WAF-style,
error, auth, and structured JSONL logs.

The AI Attack Assistant adds a second workflow for detection engineering drills.
It can generate source-shaped telemetry for selected TTPs, actor-oriented
stories, or Challenge Me scenarios. Complicated mode builds longer coherent
kill chains across web, WAF, DNS, proxy, firewall, Windows Security, Sysmon, and
EDR-style sources. The generated attack-chain graph shows phase order,
technique, event source, event format, event count, and detection purpose.

Use this module to answer:

- Which ATT&CK behaviors already have runnable validation scenarios?
- Does the lab target emit the telemetry needed by the detection rule?
- Can the SIEM parser ingest raw web, auth, endpoint, WAF, and source-shaped
  events correctly?
- Does correlation logic detect a coherent attack chain rather than one atomic
  indicator?
- Which assumptions and validation gaps must an analyst document before marking
  coverage as passed?

See the dedicated [Attack Simulation](attack-simulation.md) guide for the full
workflow, safety model, log locations, SIEM forwarding modes, AI assistant
behavior, and scenario catalog.

## Operating Notes

- Public demos are for exploration only. Do not upload private reports, client
  data, or malware samples to shared public instances.
- Docker/self-hosted mode is the private workflow for configured LLM providers,
  local LLM gateways, private reports, local IOC feeds, and malware-analysis
  labs.
- ATT&CK mapping, actor overlap, IOC enrichment, generated detections, and
  malware-analysis output are evidence organization aids. RAG ranking,
  relationship expansion, and AI answers have the same boundary. They are not
  final attribution, targeting, exploitation, detection, or verdict decisions.
- The unified corpus must be reconciled before first use. Vector retrieval is
  optional and remains disabled until an approved private embedding endpoint is
  configured; exact and full-text retrieval remain available without it.
- The optional MCP integration is a separate stdio-only local process. It can
  search and propose, but it cannot confirm proposals or mutate Navigator.
- Dynamic malware analysis is disabled by default and must run only in an
  explicitly isolated disposable runtime profile.
