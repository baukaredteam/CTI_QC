# 30 Practical AdversaryGraph Use Cases

AdversaryGraph is a self-hosted AI CTI and detection engineering platform for analysts who need to move from raw intelligence to reviewed action. It connects report analysis, log and PCAP triage, IOC enrichment, actor context, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, feed synchronization, matrix visualization, detection generation, and exportable evidence in one workflow.

The main idea is simple: an analyst should be able to take a report, IOC, log excerpt, PCAP, actor name, sector requirement, or detection gap and turn it into something operational. That output can be a reviewed ATT&CK layer, an IOC enrichment record, an actor comparison, a customer-ready investigation report, a coverage backlog, or a draft Sigma/YARA/YARA-L detection.

This article is not a generic feature list. It is a practical use-case map for the platform. Each use case starts from a real analyst situation, shows where to begin in AdversaryGraph, and defines the expected output. You can read it from top to bottom, but it is more useful as a workflow menu:

- SOC analysts can start with IOC lookup, log/PCAP triage, enrichment, and actor comparison.
- CTI analysts can start with report-to-ATT&CK mapping, actor profiles, sector intelligence, and campaign comparison.
- Detection engineers can start with Navigator layers, coverage gaps, rule feeds, and AI-assisted detection generation.
- Consultants and customer-facing analysts can start with investigation reports, executive coverage summaries, and evidence-backed exports.
- Platform operators can start with selftest, feed management, TAXII/STIX, MISP, custom feeds, and troubleshooting.

This article collects 30 practical ways to use the platform. The first 10 are simple daily actions, the next 10 are structured analyst workflows, and the final 10 are full investigation and defense workflows.

The value of these use cases is that they show how the platform pieces connect. AdversaryGraph is strongest when it is used as a workflow system, not as isolated pages. For example, an IOC lookup can become a VirusTotal enrichment, which can become mapped TTPs, which can become a Navigator comparison layer, which can become a detection backlog and a report. A vendor article can become accepted or rejected TTP evidence, actor similarity hypotheses, enriched IOCs, and a customer-ready PDF. A sector question can become a prioritized actor/TTP list for a specific customer environment.

Use this article as a checklist when demonstrating, testing, documenting, or improving the platform. If a workflow is important to your team, it should be possible to trace it through one of these use cases from input to reviewed output.

**Output:** A customer-specific detection roadmap tied to actors, sector evidence, and ATT&CK coverage.

### Usecase number "28" - Defense: Build IOC Enrichment Pipeline

**Scenario:** A SOC wants daily enrichment of IOCs from public, partner, and private sources.

**Flow:** Configure external database storage, connect ThreatFox, OTX, MalwareBazaar, Malpedia, MISP, TAXII/STIX, sandbox, and custom feeds, run sync, enrich new indicators by source priority, map IOCs to actors and TTPs, and export CSV or STIX when needed.

**Output:** A repeatable IOC enrichment pipeline with source attribution, mapped TTPs, actors, and update history.

### Usecase number "29" - Defense: Create Detection Content From CTI

**Scenario:** The detection team has CTI reports but needs usable rules for SIEM and malware tooling.

**Flow:** Analyze the source report, accept supported TTPs, open Pipeline detection generation, choose Sigma, YARA, YARA-L, KQL, SPL, or EQL, select AI provider or local model, generate rule draft, validate syntax, and attach analyst notes.

**Output:** Detection-rule handoff artifacts with CTI evidence, review status, and generated rule formats.

### Usecase number "30" - Defense: Executive Risk And Coverage Report

**Scenario:** Leadership asks which threats matter to the business and where defensive investment should go next.

**Flow:** Select sector, region, and technology filters, review ranked actors and activity windows, overlay relevant TTPs, summarize current coverage and gaps, group recommendations by business impact, and export a PDF report.

**Output:** An executive report that connects current threat relevance to measurable defensive coverage and priorities.

## Common Review Standard

- Preserve source labels and timestamps for every finding.
- Mark weak or incomplete evidence as `needs-evidence` instead of forcing a conclusion.
- Treat actor similarity as a hypothesis, not attribution.
- Prefer source-backed report evidence first, enrichment-platform evidence second, and AI enrichment only as reviewed support.
- Export only findings that have been reviewed by an analyst.
