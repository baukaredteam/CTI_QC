# AdversaryGraph v2.5: I Built a Self-Hosted AI Threat Intelligence Platform — Now With Local LLMs, DFIR Examples, and OpenCTI Export

Threat intelligence is useful only when it becomes operational.

A report is not enough. A PDF from a vendor, an incident response write-up, a malware analysis note, or a DFIR case study still needs to be translated into practical defensive work:

- What MITRE ATT&CK techniques are actually described?
- Which mappings are supported by real evidence?
- Which known groups or campaigns share similar TTPs?
- Which overlaps are only generic commodity behavior?
- Which techniques become detection gaps?
- How do I move the result into an analyst workflow, ATT&CK Navigator, PDF reporting, or OpenCTI?

That is the problem AdversaryGraph was built to solve.

AdversaryGraph is a source-available, self-hosted CTI-to-detection workbench. It helps analysts map threat reports to MITRE ATT&CK, review evidence, compare TTP overlap against groups and campaigns, export reports, and hand off structured outputs to detection engineering or CTI platforms.

Version 2.5 includes the features that make it much more useful in real analyst workflows:

- Local LLM support through OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- STIX 2.1 export for OpenCTI
- IOC Library search, sorting, and multi-group filtering
- VirusTotal IOC enrichment with ATT&CK and actor pivots
- MISP JSON, TAXII/STIX, OTX, Malpedia, and custom IOC feed workflows
- Sigma/YARA rule-feed sync and sandbox behavior enrichment
- DFIR Report example indexing
- enriched ATT&CK group and actor pages
- MITRE ATT&CK reference sync
- report-to-analysis-to-comparison demo assets
- full operator documentation

## What AdversaryGraph Is

AdversaryGraph is not a SIEM.

It is not an EDR.

It is not an attribution engine.

It is a workbench for the middle part of CTI work: the place where an analyst takes narrative reporting and turns it into ATT&CK mappings, evidence, similarity leads, detection gaps, and structured exports.

The core workflow is:

```text
report -> ATT&CK mapping candidates -> analyst review -> group/campaign/report comparison -> detection gaps -> exports
```

This matters because most threat intelligence still arrives as prose. Someone has to read it, extract behaviors, map them to ATT&CK, check the evidence, and make the result useful for detection teams.

AdversaryGraph helps automate the repetitive parts while keeping analyst review in the loop.

## Architecture

AdversaryGraph runs as a self-hosted Docker Compose stack:

- React / Vite frontend
- FastAPI backend
- PostgreSQL for ATT&CK data and analysis history
- Redis and Celery for background jobs
- scheduled MITRE ATT&CK synchronization
- optional embedded reference book

The Docker deployment is the full version. It supports private report analysis, configured LLM providers, local LLM gateways, report storage, API workflows, and exports.

The public browser workspace is for exploration and manual ATT&CK work. Do not upload private reports into public demos.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anpa1200/adversarygraph.git
cd adversarygraph
```

Create the environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Configure at least one AI provider:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4.1
GEMINI_API_KEY=
MINIMAX_API_KEY=
MINIMAX_MODEL=MiniMax-M3
MINIMAX_BASE_URL=https://api.minimax.io/v1
```

Start the stack:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open the UI:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Open the API docs:

```text
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

Check health:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

Expected result:

```json
{"status":"ok","version":"2.5.0"}
```

On first startup, AdversaryGraph ingests MITRE ATT&CK STIX data into PostgreSQL. This can take a few minutes.

## Local LLM Support

AdversaryGraph v2.5 supports local LLMs through OpenAI-compatible APIs.

This is important if you want to analyze sensitive reports without sending them to a public cloud provider.

Supported patterns include:

- Ollama
- LM Studio
- LocalAI
- vLLM
- any OpenAI-compatible internal gateway

Example with Ollama:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
ollama serve
```

Then configure:

```env
LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1
LOCAL_LLM_API_KEY=local
LOCAL_LLM_MODEL=llama3.1:8b
```

In the UI, select **Local** as the LLM provider.

Use a capable model. Small models may fail to produce clean JSON or may produce weak ATT&CK mappings.

## Discover Page

The Discover page is the starting point.

It shows:

- actor count
- technique count
- public report count
- selected TTP count
- coverage state
- most-referenced techniques
- recent public intelligence examples

It also gives quick entry points:

- investigate actor
- analyze report with AI
- compare behavior
- review coverage

This page is for orientation. It helps you decide where to start.

## AI Analysis

The AI Analysis page accepts:

- pasted text
- PDF
- DOCX
- TXT

The workflow:

1. Select ATT&CK domain: Enterprise, Mobile, or ICS.
2. Select provider: Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, MiniMax, or Local.
3. Paste text or upload a report.
4. Run analysis.
5. Watch the streamed response.
6. Review extracted techniques.
7. Inject reviewed TTPs into Navigator.
8. Export PDF or STIX/OpenCTI output.

Each extracted technique includes:

- ATT&CK ID
- technique name
- tactic
- confidence
- evidence
- review status
- evidence source

The evidence field is the most important part.

If the evidence does not show behavior, the mapping should not be accepted.

For example, an actor name in a report does not automatically prove the techniques associated with that actor. A tool name does not automatically prove every technique that tool can perform. AdversaryGraph helps generate candidates, but the analyst decides what is defensible.

## Review Status

AdversaryGraph supports analyst review states:

- suggested
- accepted
- rejected
- needs evidence

This makes the tool more useful than a simple “AI says these are TTPs” output.

You can separate raw model suggestions from reviewed findings.

That distinction matters when the output is sent to another analyst, a SOC team, a detection engineer, or OpenCTI.

## Navigator

Navigator is the ATT&CK matrix workspace.

You can:

- browse Enterprise, Mobile, and ICS ATT&CK plus MITRE ATLAS
- search techniques
- expand sub-techniques
- filter by platform
- manually select TTPs
- import ATT&CK Navigator layers
- save and load server-side layers
- overlay actor/group techniques
- export layers
- export PDF summaries

After AI Analysis, you can inject extracted techniques into Navigator and continue working manually.

This is important because ATT&CK analysis is rarely finished after one model response. Analysts need to add, remove, correct, compare, and explain.

## ATT&CK Group Library

AdversaryGraph v2.5 improves the ATT&CK Group Library.

Actor pages now include:

- ATT&CK group ID
- STIX ID
- aliases
- description
- created and modified metadata
- ATT&CK object version
- mapped technique count
- campaign count
- tactic coverage
- observed platform coverage
- technique usage evidence
- external references
- source names
- direct MITRE ATT&CK link

This makes the actor pages more useful for real CTI review.

Instead of only seeing a name and a list of techniques, you can inspect the supporting context and understand where the profile comes from.

## Group And Campaign Comparison

AdversaryGraph compares selected TTPs against:

- ATT&CK groups
- ATT&CK campaigns
- previous stored report analyses

The comparison uses Jaccard overlap.

This is useful for investigation, but it is not attribution.

A high overlap means:

```text
this TTP set shares behavior with this profile
```

It does not mean:

```text
this actor definitely did it
```

That difference matters.

Attribution needs more evidence: infrastructure, malware, victimology, timing, tooling, procedures, and external intelligence.

AdversaryGraph helps you find overlap worth investigating.

## Compare Modes

The Compare page has three modes.

### Groups

Compare your selected TTPs against ATT&CK group profiles.

Use this for:

- initial lead generation
- actor-profile overlap
- detection-gap planning

### Campaigns

Compare against named ATT&CK campaigns.

This can be more specific than group comparison because group profiles often span years of activity, while campaigns represent narrower operations.

### Reports

Compare against previous AI analyses stored in the local database.

Use this for:

- cross-report correlation
- incident clustering
- repeated behavior discovery
- retrospective comparison

## Group vs Group

The Group vs Group page compares multiple ATT&CK group profiles at once.

It includes:

- overlap matrix
- combined ATT&CK view
- technique table

This is useful when you want to understand which behaviors are shared across actors and which techniques may be more distinctive.

## DFIR Examples

AdversaryGraph v2.5 adds DFIR Examples.

The page indexes public DFIR Report metadata:

- title
- source URL
- date
- tags
- ATT&CK techniques
- actor mappings where available

AdversaryGraph does not mirror third-party report content. It stores metadata only.

The workflow is:

1. Open an indexed DFIR example.
2. Go to the original report page.
3. Save the source page as a local PDF.
4. Upload the PDF to AdversaryGraph AI Analysis.
5. Extract ATT&CK candidates.
6. Review evidence.
7. Compare against groups, campaigns, and stored reports.

This gives analysts a practical way to test the workflow with public material while respecting the original source.

## Reference Sync

ATT&CK changes over time.

AdversaryGraph includes Reference Sync for:

- Enterprise ATT&CK
- Mobile ATT&CK
- ICS ATT&CK

The sync page shows:

- current ingested version
- latest known version
- update state
- configured domains
- manual sync trigger
- force sync option

Scheduled sync runs through Celery Beat.

This matters because a report analyzed today may need to be compared again after ATT&CK changes.

## STIX 2.1 Export For OpenCTI

This is one of the most important v2.5 additions.

AdversaryGraph can export a completed analysis as a STIX 2.1 bundle:

```text
GET /api/export/analysis/{session_id}/stix
```

The UI also includes:

```text
↓ STIX/OpenCTI
```

The bundle contains:

- STIX `report`
- ATT&CK `attack-pattern` objects for extracted techniques
- optional `intrusion-set` objects for group-similarity leads
- `x_adversarygraph_*` metadata

The custom metadata includes:

- provider
- model
- ATT&CK domain
- confidence
- review status
- evidence source
- similarity score
- shared techniques

Important: this is not an IOC export.

AdversaryGraph is not mainly about indicators.

It is about reports, TTPs, ATT&CK mapping, evidence review, and detection handoff.

The OpenCTI export reflects that. It moves report and behavior context into a CTI platform without pretending that similarity equals attribution.

## PDF Export

AdversaryGraph can export a completed AI analysis as a PDF report.

The PDF includes:

- analysis metadata
- provider and model
- ATT&CK domain
- executive summary
- extracted techniques
- evidence
- confidence
- group similarity leads
- tactic coverage

This is useful for analyst handoff, internal review, and detection backlog discussions.

## ATT&CK Navigator Export

Navigator layers can be exported in ATT&CK Navigator-compatible JSON format.

This is useful when your team already uses ATT&CK Navigator and wants to continue analysis there.

You can also import existing Navigator layers into AdversaryGraph.

## API

AdversaryGraph exposes API endpoints for integration.

Common endpoints:

```text
GET  /api/health
GET  /api/attack/versions
GET  /api/attack/techniques
GET  /api/attack/techniques/{attack_id}
GET  /api/apt/groups
GET  /api/apt/groups/{group_id}
POST /api/apt/compare
GET  /api/apt/campaigns
POST /api/apt/campaigns/compare
POST /api/analyze
POST /api/analyze/stream
GET  /api/analyze/sessions
GET  /api/analyze/{session_id}
PATCH /api/analyze/sessions/{session_id}/techniques/{attack_id}/review
GET  /api/export/analysis/{session_id}
GET  /api/export/analysis/{session_id}/stix
POST /api/export/layer
GET  /api/sync/status
POST /api/sync/trigger
```

The API makes it possible to connect AdversaryGraph to internal workflows, report pipelines, or CTI tooling.

## Security And Privacy Notes

AdversaryGraph should be deployed in controlled environments.

For private work:

- self-host the Docker stack
- use a local LLM or an approved provider
- restrict network exposure
- put the app behind authentication
- use TLS
- define report retention
- define raw response retention
- back up PostgreSQL if report history matters

Do not upload confidential reports into public demos.

## What AdversaryGraph Is Not

AdversaryGraph is not:

- an attribution engine
- a SIEM
- an EDR
- a replacement for OpenCTI
- a replacement for MISP
- a replacement for ATT&CK Navigator
- a fully automated detection generator

It is a focused workbench for CTI-to-detection workflows.

Its job is to help analysts move from report text to reviewed ATT&CK evidence and useful handoff artifacts.

## Recommended Workflow

The workflow I recommend is:

1. Start with a public or authorized report.
2. Run AI Analysis.
3. Review every extracted mapping.
4. Accept only evidence-backed TTPs.
5. Inject accepted TTPs into Navigator.
6. Compare against groups.
7. Compare against campaigns.
8. Compare against previous reports.
9. Review detection gaps.
10. Export PDF for analyst handoff.
11. Export STIX/OpenCTI if promoting to a CTI platform.
12. Document uncertainty.

The most important rule:

```text
ATT&CK overlap is not attribution.
```

Use similarity as a lead. Use evidence for conclusions.

## Final Thoughts

The goal of AdversaryGraph is simple: make threat intelligence easier to operationalize.

It does not replace analysts. It gives analysts a structured place to work.

Reports become ATT&CK candidates.

Candidates become reviewed mappings.

Mappings become comparison sets.

Comparison sets become detection questions.

And reviewed results can move into PDF, Navigator, JSON, or OpenCTI.

That is the part of CTI work I wanted to improve.
