## Why This Use Case Matters

AdversaryGraph is useful when an analyst needs to move from raw intelligence to reviewed action: ATT&CK mapping, IOC enrichment, actor context, feed synchronization, matrix visualization, detection generation, and exportable evidence. This use case shows one practical way to use the platform without separating the work across spreadsheets, browser tabs, and disconnected notes.

## Real-Life Scenario

**Situation:** A CTI analyst receives a vendor report or incident write-up and needs to convert narrative text into ATT&CK evidence.

**Analyst objective:** Extract candidate TTPs, review confidence, and keep source sentences attached to each mapping.

**Operational pressure:** The analyst needs an answer that is fast enough for daily work but still traceable enough for customer reporting, detection engineering, or later peer review.

## Workflow

1. **Open AI Analysis or Investigation Report.**
2. **Paste or upload the report.**
3. **Run analysis with configured LLM provider.**
4. **Review extracted TTPs and mark them accepted, rejected, suggested, or needs-evidence.**

## Expected Output

A reviewed ATT&CK mapping with evidence snippets and analyst status for each technique.

## Analyst Review Standard

- Preserve source labels and timestamps for every finding.
- Mark weak or incomplete evidence as `needs-evidence` instead of forcing a conclusion.
- Treat actor similarity as a hypothesis, not attribution.
- Prefer source-backed report evidence first, enrichment-platform evidence second, and AI enrichment only as reviewed support.
- Export only findings that have been reviewed by an analyst.

## Where This Fits

This use case supports CTI production, SOC triage, threat hunting, detection engineering, customer reporting, or platform validation depending on the workflow level.
