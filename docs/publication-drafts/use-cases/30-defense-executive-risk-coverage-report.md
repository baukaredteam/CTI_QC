## Why This Use Case Matters

AdversaryGraph is useful when an analyst needs to move from raw intelligence to reviewed action: ATT&CK mapping, IOC enrichment, actor context, feed synchronization, matrix visualization, detection generation, and exportable evidence. This use case shows one practical way to use the platform without separating the work across spreadsheets, browser tabs, and disconnected notes.

## Real-Life Scenario

**Situation:** Leadership asks which threats matter to the business and where defensive investment should go next.

**Analyst objective:** Translate CTI, actor relevance, IOC trends, and ATT&CK coverage into an executive-ready report.

**Operational pressure:** The analyst needs an answer that is fast enough for daily work but still traceable enough for customer reporting, detection engineering, or later peer review.

## Workflow

1. **Select sector, region, and technology filters.**
2. **Review ranked actors and activity windows.**
3. **Overlay relevant TTPs on matrix.**
4. **Summarize current coverage and gaps.**
5. **Group recommendations by business impact.**
6. **Export PDF report with evidence links and next actions.**

## Expected Output

An executive report that connects current threat relevance to measurable defensive coverage and priorities.

## Analyst Review Standard

- Preserve source labels and timestamps for every finding.
- Mark weak or incomplete evidence as `needs-evidence` instead of forcing a conclusion.
- Treat actor similarity as a hypothesis, not attribution.
- Prefer source-backed report evidence first, enrichment-platform evidence second, and AI enrichment only as reviewed support.
- Export only findings that have been reviewed by an analyst.

## Where This Fits

This use case supports CTI production, SOC triage, threat hunting, detection engineering, customer reporting, or platform validation depending on the workflow level.
