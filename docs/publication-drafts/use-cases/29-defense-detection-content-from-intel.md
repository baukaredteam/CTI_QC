## Why This Use Case Matters

AdversaryGraph is useful when an analyst needs to move from raw intelligence to reviewed action: ATT&CK mapping, IOC enrichment, actor context, feed synchronization, matrix visualization, detection generation, and exportable evidence. This use case shows one practical way to use the platform without separating the work across spreadsheets, browser tabs, and disconnected notes.

## Real-Life Scenario

**Situation:** The detection team has CTI reports but needs usable rules for SIEM and malware tooling.

**Analyst objective:** Generate analyst-reviewed detection drafts from accepted CTI evidence.

**Operational pressure:** The analyst needs an answer that is fast enough for daily work but still traceable enough for customer reporting, detection engineering, or later peer review.

## Workflow

1. **Analyze the source report.**
2. **Accept supported TTPs and reject weak ones.**
3. **Open Pipeline detection generation.**
4. **Choose Sigma, YARA, YARA-L, KQL, SPL, or EQL.**
5. **Select AI provider or local model.**
6. **Generate rule draft.**
7. **Validate syntax and add analyst notes.**
8. **Attach rule to the investigation package.**

## Expected Output

Detection-rule handoff artifacts with CTI evidence, review status, and generated rule formats.

## Analyst Review Standard

- Preserve source labels and timestamps for every finding.
- Mark weak or incomplete evidence as `needs-evidence` instead of forcing a conclusion.
- Treat actor similarity as a hypothesis, not attribution.
- Prefer source-backed report evidence first, enrichment-platform evidence second, and AI enrichment only as reviewed support.
- Export only findings that have been reviewed by an analyst.

## Where This Fits

This use case supports CTI production, SOC triage, threat hunting, detection engineering, customer reporting, or platform validation depending on the workflow level.
